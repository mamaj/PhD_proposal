This proposal will cover the results and future directions on multiple projects I have been leading or involved in: 

1) fMRI data analysis: In collaboration with CAMH, we developed a novel Bayesian model of multi-subject high-dimensional fMRI time series, using Gaussian Process Priors. In addition, we use Graph Signal Processing to explore how brain activity patterns correlate with the resting-state brain network. 

% 2) Distributed coded training on the cloud: Implementation and evaluation of gradient coding methods on AWS cloud infrastructure is presented. We discuss the challenges and limitations of training on the AWS Lambda service. 

2) Entropy-based Lossy Compression: We introduce an information-theoretic framework for lossy compression by incorporating entropy as the loss function. As a special case, we explore maximum mutual information matching between two discrete random variables. 

3) Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection in high-dimensional distributions: We discuss the relationship between the concentration of measure, sample complexity, and out-of-distribution detection. Further, we show how the likelihood domain deviates from the sample domain as the input dimension increases and explain the implications of this on OOD detection.
